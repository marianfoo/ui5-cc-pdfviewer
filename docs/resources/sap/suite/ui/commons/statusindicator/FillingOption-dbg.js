					 * half-full. The rest of the SVG shapes appear empty.</li>
					 *   <li>If the status indicator's value is at least 10% but below 30%, the first SVG
					 * shape (weight 1) is filled, and the second shape (weight 2) is filled only partially,
					 * depending on the percentage value. The rest of the SVG shapes in this custom shape
					 * appear empty.</li>
					 *   <li>If the status indicator's value is at least 30% but below 60%, the first two
					 * SVG shapes (weight 1 and 2) are filled, and the third SVG shape (weight 3) is filled
					 * only partially. The fourth SVG shape (weight 4) appears empty.</li>
					 *   <li>If the status indicator's value is at least 60% but below 100%, the first three
					 * SVG shapes (weight 1, 2, and 3) are filled, but the fourth SVG shape is filled only
					 * partially, depending on the percentage value.</li>
