         * Create a model from a piece of configuration.

         * @param {variant} vPathOrDefinition
         *   A path pointing at a node of the configuration contract. Or an
         *   object pointing at several parts of the configuration contract.
         *   For example:
         *<pre>"/core/shell"</pre>
         *   or:
         *<pre>{ path1: "/core/shell/A", path2: "/core/shell/B" }</pre>
         *
         * @param {function} Constructor
         *   A constructor that constructs a model. The constructor will be
         *   called with an object as an argument and must construct a model,
         *   which is an object with at least a setter. Today we require that
         *   the setter has a method called 'setProperty' that usually writes
         *   in the model based on path specifications and the binding context.
         *   These qualities are fulfilled by the JSONModel constructor from
         *   <code>sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel</code> which is not part of this
         *   module to avoid an unnecessary dependency that comes into play
         *   only when UI5 is fully loaded. Before that time (e.g., during
         *   bootstrap) we should write into the configuration rather than
         *   creating a model.
         *
         * @return {object}
         *   A model where setProperty will be called whenever corresponding
         *   properties on the configuration change.
         *
         * @private
