	 * @deprecated Since version 1.32.0.
	 * The chart controls in the <code>sap.viz.ui5</code> package (which were always marked as <i>experimental</i>) have been deprecated since 1.32.0.
	 * They are no longer actively developed and won't receive new features or improvements, only important bug fixes. They will only remain in the
	 * SAPUI5 distribution for backward compatibility.
	 *
	 * <b>SAP strongly recommends that existing consumers of those controls migrate to the new {@link sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame VizFrame}
	 * control to benefit from new charting enhancements and timely support. </b>
	 *
	 * <b>Note</b>: As the feature set, design and API usage of VizFrame might differ from the old chart controls, make sure you evaluate it thoroughly before migration.
	 * @experimental Since version 1.7.2.
	 * Charting API is not finished yet and might change completely.

			 *                 Currently two decorations are supported: showDetail and hideDetail.
			 *                 These two decorations can be used to create a user-defined tooltip.
			 *
			 * If these 2 decorations are used, the default tooltip is not used,
			 *                 and the user should implement a custom tooltip.
			 *                 The showDetail decoration is called when the tooltip is shown,
			 *                 and the hideDetail decoration is called when the tooltip is hidden.
			 *
			 * The arguments of showDetail are one object of {mode: 'tooltip mode',
			 *                 data: 'data of hovering selected data point', position: 'mouse position',
			 *                 container: 'chart container dom element', selectedNumber: 'number of selected data points'}.
			 *                 'tooltip mode' is either 'infoMode' or 'actionMode'. Hovering over an unselected data point displays the infoMode tooltip,
			 *                 while hovering over a selected data point displays the actionMode tooltip.
			 *                 'data' is an array of dimensions and measures, where each item is an object of
			 *                 {name: 'dimension name or measure name', value: 'dimension member or measure value',
			 *                 type: 'literal string of dimension or measure'}. For instance,
			 *                 {name: 'Country', value: 'China', type: 'dimension'}, or
			 *                 {name: 'Profit', value: 159, type: 'measure'}.
			 *
			 * The arguments of hideDetail are a string representing tooltip mode,
			 *                 i.e. what kind of tooltip should be hidden.
